# a
False
First, We prove, If a turing machine $M$ recognizes a language $L$, then $\forall L'$ where, $L\not ={L'}$ $M$ doesn't recognize $L'$
Since $M$ recognizes $L$ therefore, if and only if $x \in L$ then $M$ accepts $x$ from the definition of recognizability.
case 1: $L - L'$ is a non empty set. now $\forall x \in L - L'$ since, $x \in L$ , by the definition of set difference, $M$ accepts $x$ since $M$ recognizes $L$ but $x \notin L'$ therefore $M$ doesn't recognizes $L'$.
case 2: $L - L' =\phi$ then $L' - L$ is a non empty set since $L \not ={L'}$, then $\forall x \in L' - L$ $M$ doesn't accept $x$ since $x \notin L$ and $M$ recognizes $L$, but $x$ is in $L'$, therefore $M$ doesn't recognizes $L'$ 
Therefore, If a turing machine $M$ recognizes a language $L$, then $\forall L'$ where, $L\not ={L'}$ $M$ doesn't recognize $L'$ or a TM can only recognize one Language.


We devised a Turing Machine called **U** that recognizes $Accept_{TM}$ and we proved that it does not decide $Accept_{TM}$ [From lecture 51]. 
And we proved that, a Turing Machine can recognize only one language hence, there is no language $L'\not ={Accept_{TM}}$ such that U recognizes $L'$.
It follows that, U only recognize $Accept_{TM}$, it doesn't recognize any other language.
Now since $\forall L' \not ={Accept_{TM}}$ $M$ doesn't recognize $L'$ then there exists $x \in L'$ such that $M$ doesn't accept $x$ or there exists $x \notin L'$ such that $M$ accept $x$.
From the definition of Language decideability we can conclude that, $M$ doesn't decide $L'$
Now in **lecture 51**, we proved $Accept_{TM}$ is undecideable.
hence $U$ doesn't decide $Accept_{TM}$

Therefore, $\exist$ a TM $U$, such that, $\forall L$, $U$ doesn't decide $L$.
Hence the given statement is false.
