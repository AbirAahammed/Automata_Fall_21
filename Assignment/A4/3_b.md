Explaination:
Assuming initially the tapehead is pointing to the first symbol of the string on the tape.
1. We are pointing at a $ symbol and we are in state **A**
2. On reading $ we move the tapehead to right and mvoe to state **C**
3. At **C** we keep moving the tapehead to right without replacing any symbol on seeing **0** or **1**. When we see symbol **_** we move the tapehead to left without replacing the symbol and move to state **D**.
4. At state D, we keep moving the tapehead to left as we see 1, each time we replace 1 with 0.
   **a.** On seeign 0 at state **D**
      1. We replace 0 with 1 and move the tapehead to left, and move to state **G**.
      2. At state **G**, we keep moving the tapehead to left without replacing any symbol on seeing **0** or **1**. When we see symbol **$** we move the tapehead to left without replacing the symbol and move to final state **H**.
   
   **b.** On seeing $ at state **D**
      1. We move the tapehead to right without replacing any symbol, and move to state **E**
      2. At state **E**, we see a 0 and replace it with 1 and move the tapehead to right and move to state **F**.
      3. At state F, we keep moving the tapehead to right as we see 0, without replacing any symbol. As we see empty symbol **_**, we move the tapehead to left and move to state **G**, from then on we follow, procedure from 4.a.2.
