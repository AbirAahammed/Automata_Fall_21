We assume that, the tape contents will initially be **\$** followed by an integer N > 1 written in base-2 (binary), and assume that the first symbol of N is 1. The tape head is initially pointingto the $## Pseudocode:

## Pseudocode:
1. If the current symbol is **$** then move right. It corresponds transitioning from state ***A*** to ***C***.
2. Move right until the current square is non **0** or non **1**. [state ***C***]
3. If the current symbol is **_** then move left else reject. This corresponds to transition from state ***C*** to state ***D***.
4. Move left until the current square is non **1** and replacing each **1** with **0**. [state ***D***]
5. If current square symbol is **0** replace it with **1** and move left, and skip to step **9**. This corresponds to transition from state ***D*** to state ***G***,
Else if current square symbol is **$** move right, this corresponds to transition from state ***D*** to state ***E***.
Else reject.
6. If the current symbol is **0** then replace it with 1 and move right else reject. This corresponds to transition from state ***E*** to state ***F***.
7. Move right until the current square symbol is non **0**. [State ***F***]
8. If the current symbol is **_** then replace it with symbol **0**. This corresponds to transition from state ***F*** to state ***G***.
9. Move left until the current square is non **0** or non **1**. [state ***G***]
10. If the current symbol is **$** then move to left and **accept**. This corresponds to transition from state ***G*** to final accepting state ***H***.
<!-- Explaination:
Assuming initially the tapehead is pointing to the first symbol of the string on the tape.
1. We are pointing at a $ symbol and we are in state **A**
2. On reading $ we move the tapehead to right and mvoe to state **C**
3. At **C** we keep moving the tapehead to right without replacing any symbol on seeing **0** or **1**. When we see symbol **_** we move the tapehead to left without replacing the symbol and move to state **D**.
4. At state D, we keep moving the tapehead to left as we see 1, each time we replace 1 with 0.
   **a.** On seeign 0 at state **D**
      1. We replace 0 with 1 and move the tapehead to left, and move to state **G**.
      2. At state **G**, we keep moving the tapehead to left without replacing any symbol on seeing **0** or **1**. When we see symbol **$** we move the tapehead to left without replacing the symbol and move to final state **H**.
   
   **b.** On seeing $ at state **D**
      1. We move the tapehead to right without replacing any symbol, and move to state **E**
      2. At state **E**, we see a 0 and replace it with 1 and move the tapehead to right and move to state **F**.
      3. At state F, we keep moving the tapehead to right as we see 0, without replacing any symbol. As we see empty symbol **_**, we move the tapehead to left and move to state **G**, from then on we follow, procedure from 4.a.2. -->
