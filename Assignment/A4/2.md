Let, for $n\geq 1$
$t_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ is a triangle number
$t_{n+1} = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$ is the next triangle number

We know,$t_{n+1} - t_n = n+1$ or, $t_{n+1} = t_n + n + 1$ 

Now for an arbitrary $n\geq 1$ we prove that the string $1^{\frac{n(n+1)}{2}}$ or, $1^{t_n}$ is not equivalent to any string, $1^{\frac{n(n+1)}{2}}$ or, $1^{t_n}$ where $m>n$

Let, $X = 1^{n+1}$
then, $1^{t_n} \cdot X = 1^{t_n} \cdot 1^{n+1} = 1^{t_n+n+1} = 1^{t_{n+1}}$, since, $t_n$ is a triangular number and the next triangular number is $t_{n+1} = t_n + n+1$ therefore, the string, $1^{t_n} \cdot X \notin L$

and $1^{t_m} \cdot X = 1^{t_m} \cdot 1^{n+1} = 1^{t_m+n+1}$

Now since, $t_m = \frac{m(m+1)}{2}$,  $t_m$ is a triangular number.
$t_{m+1} = t_m + m + 1$, Now since, $m>n \implies m+1 > n+1$
$t_m < t_m+n+1 < t_{m+1}$

Since $t_m+n+1$ between 2 consecutive triangualr numbers hence it is not a triangualr number, therefore, $1^{t_m} \cdot X$ or $1^{t_m+n+1} \in L$

Hence, $1^{t_n}$ and $1^{t_m}$ are not equivalent to each other with respect to L, where $n\geq 1$ and , $m>n$,

We have shown that there is a different equivalence class for each string $1^{t_n}$ where, $t_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ or $t_n$ is a triangualr number.
Since there are an inifinite number of such strings, the number of equivalence classes is infinite.By the Myhill-Nerode Theorem, this concludes the proof that L is not regular.
