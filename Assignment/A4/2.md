Let, for $n\geq 1$
$T_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ is a triangle number
$T_{n+1} = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$ is the next triangle number

We know,$T_{n+1} - T_n = n+1$ or, $T_{n+1} = T_n + n + 1$ [from answers to $1(c)$]

Now for an arbitrary $n\geq 1$ we prove that the string $1^{\frac{n(n+1)}{2}}$ or, $1^{T_n}$ is not equivalent to any string, $1^{\frac{m(m+1)}{2}}$ or, $1^{T_m}$ where $m>n$

Let, $X = 1^{n+1}$
then, $1^{T_n} \cdot X = 1^{T_n} \cdot 1^{n+1} = 1^{T_n+n+1} = 1^{T_{n+1}}$, since, $T_n$ is a triangular number and the next triangular number is $T_{n+1} = T_n + n+1$ therefore, the string, $1^{T_n} \cdot X \notin L$

and $1^{T_m} \cdot X = 1^{T_m} \cdot 1^{n+1} = 1^{T_m+n+1}$

Now since, $T_m = \frac{m(m+1)}{2}$,  $T_m$ is a triangular number.
$T_{m+1} = T_m + m + 1$, Now since, $m>n \implies m+1 > n+1 \implies T_m+m+1 > T_m+n+1$

$T_m < T_m+n+1 < T_m+m+1$, it follows that, $T_m < T_m+n+1 < T_{m+1}$
It follows that, $T_m+n+1$ is not a triangular number
Therefore, $1^{T_m} \cdot X$ or, $1^{T_m+n+1}\notin L$

This proves that, $1^{T_n}$ and $1^{T_m}$ are not equivalent with respect to L,
or, $1^{\frac{n(n+1)}{2}}$ and $1^{\frac{m(m+1)}{2}}$ are not equivalent with respect to L.

We have shown that there is a different equivalence class for each string $1^{T_n}$ where, $T_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ or $t_n$ is a triangualr number.
Since there are an inifinite number of such strings, the number of equivalence classes is infinite. By the Myhill-Nerode Theorem, this concludes the proof that L is not regular.
