<!-- Describe the Machine with the marked state;
1. Start From $
2. Keep going right on 1 and x keeping symbols unchanged Until see a 0 or #
   1. __Saw a 0:__ replace 0 with x, move right

The machine passes thru the string in each pass it crosses of 2 0's at one 0 interval. that is in a string it will cross off 1st and 2nd 0 then leave 3rd 0. cross off 4th and 5th 0 then leave 6th uncahnged. Nothing else will be changhed. After each pass it will updat the string following #. Where it will count the number passes done so far in binary. Once the machine is doen crossing of all 0's it will show the total number of passes required to cross off all 0's in the aforementioned manner. -->

$\$W'\#X_2\_$, where $W'$ is the string obtained by replacing all 0's from $W$ with $x$ and $X_2$ is the binary string represnting an integer, such that, $3^a > \#_0(W) \geq 3^{a-1}$ where, $a$ is the integer represented by $X_2$ in binary
