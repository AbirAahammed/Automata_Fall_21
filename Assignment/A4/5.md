# a
False
We devised a TM called U that recognizes $Accept_{TM}$ and we proved that it doesnot decide $Accept_{TM}$. A TM can recognize only one language hence, there is no other language $L'\not ={Accept_{TM}}$ that U recognizes.

Therefore, $\exist$ a TM $U$, such that, $\forall L$ $U$ doesn't decide $L$.

# b

True
For an arbritary Turing machine $T_m$, $\mathscr{L}(T_m) = \{W \in {0, 1}^* | W$ is accepted by $T_m\}$
Now if, $W \notin \mathscr{L}(T_m)$ then $T_m$ doesn't accept $W$, 
Hence, $T_m$ recognizes $\mathscr{L}(T_m)$
