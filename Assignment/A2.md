- State A:
  - No consecutive 0 is found 
  - string ends in 1
- State B:
  - No consecutive 0 is found
  - string ends with 0
- State C:
  - Have seen 2 or more consecutive 0's

#### Invariants
| No  | State | Invariant                                               |
| --- | :---: | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   |   A   | String has no consecutive 2 0's.                        |
| 2   |   B   | String has no consecutive 2 0's. Last symbol read is 0. |
| 3   |   C   | Have seen at least one instance of consecutive 0's.     |

Proof:
We proceed by induction on the length of an arbritary string $W$.

#### Base case
For the base case, $W=\epsilon$, notice that we are in $A$and $W$ has no 2 consecutive 0's. hence out invariant 1 is true.

When $W=\epsilon$ we are not in state B and C, so invariant 2 and 3 are are vacuously true.

#### Induction hypothesis
1. If the current state A, then W has no consecutive 2 0's. Last symbol read is 1.
2. If the current state B, then W has no consecutive 2 0's. Last symbol read is 0.
3. If the current state C, then W has at least one consecutive 2 0's.

#### Inductive step
Let's consider a string W of length $k+1$
##### Invariant 1
Direct Proof: Suppose that after reading $W = Y \cdot z$, the current state is $A$,

for z = 1
For M we conclude that the machine was in state $A$ or $B$ after reading $Y$. 
By induction hypothesis $Y$ has no 2 consecutive 2 0's.
Therefore for $z = 1$, $W = Y \cdot z$ has no 2 consecutive 0's and last symbol of $W$ is 1.

##### Invariant 2
Direct Proof: Suppose that after reading $W = Y \cdot z$, the current state is $B$,

for z = 0,
for M we conclude that the machine was in state $A$ after reading $Y$. 
By induction hypothesis $Y$ has no 2 consecutive 0's and last symbol read is 1.
Therefore for $z = 0$, $W = Y \cdot z$ has no 2 consecutive 0's and last symbol of $W$ is 0.

##### Invariant 3
Direct Proof: Suppose that after reading $W = Y \cdot z$, the current state is $C$,

###### Case 1
z = 0
For given M, we conclude that the machine was in state $B$ or $C$ after reading $Y$

- Case 1.1 (machine was in state $B$)
  - By induction hypothesis, $Y$ has no 2 consecutive 0 and the last symbol of the string is 0.
  - Since z = 0, $W = Y \cdot z$ has at least one consecutive 2 0's.
- Case 1.2 (machine was in state $C$)
  - By induction hypothesis, $Y$ has at least one consecutive 2 0's.
  - therefore W also has at least one consecutive 2 0's.

###### Case 2
z = 1
For given M, we conclude that the machine was in state $C$ after reading $Y$
By induction hypothesis $Y$ has at least one consecutive 2 0's.
therfore $W$ has at least one consecutive 2 0's.

Hence by induction principle all the invariants are proved.

- From the machine description we see that the accepting states are $A,\ B$
- We proved invariant 1: if the machine is in state A, then the string has no consecutive 2 0's.
- We proved invariant 2: if the machine is in state B, then the string has no consecutive 2 0's.
- We proved invariant 3: if the machine is in state C, then the string has at least 1 consecutive 2 0's.
- In other words M accepts $W \implies W \in L$, and, M rejects $W \implies W \notin L$, as rquired.
