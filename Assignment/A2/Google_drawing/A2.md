## a 
**True**
Let L is a finite language, and Let |L| = n, for some $n \geq 0$
For n = 0, $L = \phi$ and it is regular.
For $n>0$, 
lets , $L = \{a_1, a_2, a_3,....a_n\}$ where $a_k\ for \ k \geq 1$ is the individual string in $L$.
Now, for each string $a_k \in L$ we generate a new Language, $L_k = {a_k}$ for $k\geq 1$.
We can draw a DFA for a language that has a single string. therefore all $L_k$ for $k\geq 1$ is regular.
Since, $L = L_1 \cup L_2 \cup .....\cup L_k$ and set of regular language is closed under Union operation. therefore L is a regular language.

## b
**False**
We will disprove the satement with an example,
Let, $L = \{W \in \{0, 1\}^*$| W contains an even number of 0's$\}$
This is a regular language as we have constructed a DFA for this language, in Lecture 7, but it is a infinite language. 
Therefore there exists a regular language that is finite.
## c
**False**
We will disprove the satement with an example,
Language of all binary string is regular, we can draw a DFA. with one state.
$L = \{W \in \{0,1\}^*\}$, L is regular. As shown by the DFA below.
DFA:
![DFA](../img/Assignment/A2/1_c.png)
But $L' = \{W \in \{0,1\}*$|$W = 0^k1^k,$for $k\geq 0\}$ is not regular though $L' \subset L$
Hence the statement is false.
## d
**False**
We will disprove the satement with an example,

Lets consider infinitely many language with only one string, Such that, $L_k = {0^k1^k}$ where, $k \geq 0$,
For All $k \geq 0$ such $L_k$ is regular as a language with one string is regular.
But if we take union of such infinite number of language where, $L = L_0 \cup L_1 \cup  L_2 \cup L_3 \cup .......= \{W \in \{0,1\}*$|$W = 0^k1^k,$for $k\geq 0\}$ Which we have proved that a non regular language in lecture 10.
Hence the statement is false.

## e
**True**
Let, We have n regular languages, $L_1, L_2, L_3,......,L_n$
We consider , $L = L_1 \cup L_2 \cup L_3 \cup ...... \cup L_n$
Since, Regular language are closed under union, therefore L is regular
## f
**False**
We will disprove the satement with an example,

![img](../img/Assignment/A2/1_f_1.png)
NFA 2 is generated from NFA 1 using the algorithm described in the statement.

Here If we pick a string $x = 0$ then x is accepted by both the NFA's. 
Hence NFA 2 is not valid NFA for complement of L where L is accepted by NFA 1.
Therefore the statement is false.

After running the DFA on input $W$, the following three Invariants are true.
**Invariant 1:** If the current state is A, then $W$ has no consecutive 0's and if $|W|\geq 1$ then, the last symbol of $Y$ is 1
**Invariant 2:** If the current state is B, then $W$ has no consecutive 0's and last symbol of $W$ is 0.
**Invariant 2:** If the current state is C, then $W$ has at least one instance of consecutive 0's.
<!-- | No  | State | Invariant                                             |
| --- | :---: | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   |   A   | String has no consecutive 0's.                        |
| 2   |   B   | String has no consecutive 0's. Last symbol read is 0. |
| 3   |   C   | Have seen at least one instance of consecutive 0's.   | -->

We will prove that the, the DFA accepts if $W \in \mathscr{L}(M)$
#### Proof:
We proceed by induction on the length of $W$.

#### Base case
For the base case, $W=\epsilon$, notice that we are in $A$and $W$ has no 2 consecutive 0's. hence out invariant 1 is true.

When $W=\epsilon$ we are not in state $B$ and $C$, so invariant 2 and 3 are vacuously true.

#### Induction hypothesis
Assume that, after running the DFA on any string Y of length $k\geq 0$, the following statements are true:
1. If the current state A, then Y has no consecutive 0's and if $|Y|\geq 1$ then, the last symbol of $Y$ is 1.
2. If the current state B, then Y has no consecutive 0's. Last symbol of $Y$ is 0.
3. If the current state C, then Y has at least one consecutive 2 0's.

#### Inductive step
<!-- After running the DFA on any string W of length $k+1$
We need to proof:
1. If the current state A, then W has no consecutive 0's. Last symbol of $W$ is 1.
2. If the current state B, then W has no consecutive 0's. Last symbol of $W$ is 0.
3. If the current state C, then W has at least one consecutive 2 0's. -->
Let's consider a string $W$ of length $k+1$, such that, $W = Y \cdot z,$ where $z$ is the final symbol of $W$.

##### Invariant 1
Suppose that after reading $W = Y \cdot z$, the current state is $A$,
From the diagram of machine, we conclude that the machine was in state $A$ or $B$ after reading $Y$,
For z = 1, we consider, 
**Case 1:** consider the machine was in State $A$,
By induction hypothesis, $Y$ has no consecutive 0's, hence $W = Y \cdot z$ also has no consecutive 0's.
**Case 1:** consider the machine was in State $B$,
By induction hypothesis, $Y$ has no consecutive 0's, hence $W = Y \cdot z$ also has no consecutive 0's.


##### Invariant 2
Suppose that after reading $W = Y \cdot z$, the current state is $B$,
From the diagram of machine, we conclude that the machine was in state $A$ after reading $Y$,
For z = 0,
By induction hypothesis, 
$Y$ has no consecutive 0's and the last symbol of Y is 1. therefore, $W = Y \cdot z$ has no consecutive 0's.


##### Invariant 3
Direct Proof: Suppose that after reading $W = Y \cdot z$, the current state is $C$,
There 2 cases of z for whcih we can be in state $c$
###### Case 1
z = 0
From the diagram of machine, we conclude that the machine was in state $B$ or $C$ after reading $Y$,

- **Case 1.1** (machine was in state $B$)
  - By induction hypothesis, $Y$ has no 2 consecutive 0 and the last symbol of the string is 0.
  - Since z = 0, $W = Y \cdot z$ has at least one consecutive 0's.
- **Case 1.2** (machine was in state $C$)
  - By induction hypothesis, $Y$ has at least one consecutive 2 0's.
  - therefore $W = Y \cdot z$ also has at least one consecutive 2 0's.

###### Case 2
z = 1
From the diagram of machine, we conclude that the machine was in state $C$ after reading $Y$,

By induction hypothesis $Y$ has at least one consecutive 0's.
therfore $W = Y \cdot z$ has at least one consecutive  0's.

Hence by induction principle all the invariants are proved.

- From the machine description we see that the accepting states are **$A,\ B$**
- We proved invariant 1: if the machine is in state **A**, then the string has no consecutive 2 0's.
- We proved invariant 2: if the machine is in state **B**, then the string has no consecutive 2 0's.
- We proved invariant 3: if the machine is in state **C**, then the string has at least 1 consecutive 2 0's.

In other words M accepts $W \implies W$ has no consecutive 0's, and, M rejects $W \implies W$ has consecutive 0's. Thus proving our statement in part a.

All the Myhill-Nerode equivalence classes induced by L are as follows, 

$C_1=\{W \in \{0, 1\}^* \| W=1^k\ where\ k \geq 1\}$  
$C_2 =\{W \in \{0, 1\}^* \| W=\epsilon\}$             
$C_3=\{W \in \{0, 1\}^* \| W=0^k\ where\ k \geq 1\}$  
$C_4=\{W \in \{0, 1\}^* \| W=1^k0\ where\ k \geq 1\}$ 
$C_5=\{W \in \{0, 1\}^* \| W=1^k0\ where\ k \geq 1\}$ 

Two prove these are the Myhill-Nerode equivalence classes of L,
We need to prove that,
1. All strings in $C_1$ are equivalent to each other with respect to L.
2. All strings in $C_2$ are equivalent to each other with respect to L.
3. All strings in $C_3$ are equivalent to each other with respect to L.
4. All strings in $C_4$ are equivalent to each other with respect to L.
5. All strings in $C_5$ are equivalent to each other with respect to L.
6. There exists, a string in $C_1$, that is not equivalent to $C_2$ with respect to L.
7. There exists, a string in $C_1$, that is not equivalent to $C_3$ with respect to L.
8. There exists, a string in $C_1$, that is not equivalent to $C_4$ with respect to L.
9. There exists, a string in $C_1$, that is not equivalent to $C_5$ with respect to L.
10. There exists, a string in $C_2$, that is not equivalent to $C_3$ with respect to L.
11. There exists, a string in $C_2$, that is not equivalent to $C_4$ with respect to L.
12. There exists, a string in $C_2$, that is not equivalent to $C_5$ with respect to L.
13. There exists, a string in $C_3$, that is not equivalent to $C_4$ with respect to L.
14. There exists, a string in $C_3$, that is not equivalent to $C_5$ with respect to L.
15. There exists, a string in $C_4$, that is not equivalent to $C_5$ with respect to L.

We will use the following statement to check if a String belongs in L or not.
**If a string is of the form $0^n$ where $n\geq 0$ or of the form $1^m0$ where $m \geq 1$ then the string is in L.**

**Proof: All strings in $C_1$ are equivalent to each other with respect to L.**
Let A and B be 2 arbritary string in $C_1$,
Consider string X, where
**case 1** X is of the form $1^k0$ where $k \geq 0$
then both $AX$ and $BX$ are of the form $1^m0$ where $m\geq 1$
therefore, $AX$ and $BX$ $\in L$
**case 2** X is not of the form $1^k0$  where $k \geq 0$
then none of the $AX$ or $BX$ are of the form $1^m0$ where $m\geq 1$ or $0^n$ where $n \geq 0$
therefore, $AX$, $BX$ $\notin L$
This concludes the proof that an arbitrary A and B from $C_1$ are equivalent with respect to L.

**Proof: All strings in $C_2$ are equivalent to each other with respect to L.**
Since $C_2$ has only one element therefore the statement is vacuously true

**Proof: All strings in $C_3$ are equivalent to each other with respect to L.**
Let A and B be 2 arbritary string in $C_3$,
Consider string X, where
**case 1** $X \in \{W \in \{0, 1\}^*|W = 0^n\ for\ n \geq 0\}$
then both $AX$ and $BX$ are of the form $0^m$ where $m \geq 0$ and thus $AX, BX \in L$
**case 2** $X$ contains at aleast one 1 as symbol.
then none of the $AX$ or $BX$ are of the form $1^m0$ where $m\geq 1$ or $0^n$ where $n \geq 0$
therefore, both $AX$ and $BX$ are not in L, as for a string starting with 0 can only contain 0, but X has at least 1 and thus both $AX$ and $BX$ at least one or more 1 and L has no such string.

This concludes the proof that an arbitrary A and B from $C_3$ are equivalent with respect to L.

**Proof: All strings in $C_4$ are equivalent to each other with respect to L.**

Let A and B be 2 arbritary string in $C_4$,
Consider string X, where
case 1 X = $\epsilon$
then both $AX$ and $BX$ are of the form $1^m0$ where $m\geq 1$

case 2 $X$ a non empty string,
then none of the $AX$ or $BX$ are of the form $1^m0$ where $m\geq 1$ or $0^n$ where $n \geq 0$

therefore, both $AX$ and $BX$ $\notin L$

This concludes the proof that an arbitrary A and B from $C_4$ are equivalent with respect to L.


**Proof: All strings in $C_5$ are equivalent to each other with respect to L.**
Let A and B be 2 arbritary string in $C_5$,
Consider an arbritary string X,
then none of the $AX$ or $BX$ are of the form $1^m0$ where $m\geq 1$ or $0^n$ where $n \geq 0$

i.e. for all X $AX$ and $BX$ $\notin L$
This concludes the proof that an arbitrary A and B from $C_5$ are equivalent with respect to L.


**Proof: There exists, a string in $C_1$, that is not equivalent to $C_2$ with respect to L.**
We chose, A = 11 from $C_1$ and B = $\epsilon$ from $C_2$,
for X = $\epsilon$
$A \cdot X \notin L$
$B \cdot X \in L$
therfore, $C_1, C_2$ forms seperate equivalence class

Thus we have proved that, $C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4, C_5$ are the 5 Myhill-nerode equivalence classes induced by the given L.
