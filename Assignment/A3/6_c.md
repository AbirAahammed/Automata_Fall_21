Let's consider, $P(\sum_n)$ It gives all possible combination of alphabets in $\sum_n$

Now we know that, $|P(\sum_n)| = 2^m$

<!-- For all set $S_1, S_2 \in P(\sum_n)$, let's consider a set of string that  -->
Let's consider a string A and B such that, for an arbritary $S_A, S_B \in P(\sum_n)$ where, $S_A \not ={S_B}$ and $A$ has all alphabets in $S_A$ at least once and  $B$ has all alphabets in $S_B$ at least once.

__case 1: $|S_A| \leq |S_B|$__
then, $|\sum_n - S_A| \geq |\sum_n - S_B|$
and $\sum_n - S_A \not ={\sum_n - S_B}$ $\because$ $S_A \not ={S_B}$
let's consider a string $X$ that has all alphabets from $\sum_n - S_B$, then
$A \cdot X \in L_n$ since $\exist x \in \sum_n,$ and $A \cdot X$ does not contain $x$
but since $\sum_n - S_B$ is complement of $S_B$ considering $\sum_n$ as the unversal set.
hence $B \cdot X$ has all the alphabets from $\sum_n$ 
therefore, $B \cdot X \notin L_n$ 
Therefore string A and B are in 2 different equivalence class.

__case 2: $|S_A| > |S_B|$__
then, $|\sum_n - S_A| < |\sum_n - S_B|$
and $\sum_n - S_A \not ={\sum_n - S_B}$ $\because$ $S_A \not ={S_B}$
let's consider a string $X$ that has all alphabets from $\sum_n - S_A$, then
since, $\forall x \in \sum_n,$ and $A \cdot X$ contain $x$ at least once, $A \cdot X \notin L_n$ 
But, $\exist x \in \sum_n,$ and $B \cdot X$ does not contain $x$, therefore $B \cdot X \in L_n$
Therefore string A and B are in 2 different equivalence class.

We proved that, for both cases $A$ and $B$ are in different equivalence classes,

We have $|P(\sum_n)|$ or $2^n$ such equivalence classes. Therefore the DFA that decides $L_n$ has atleast $2^n$ states.
