For an arbitrary $n \geq 0$, we prove that the string $0^n01$ is not equivalent to any string $0^m01$ where $m = n + 2$
Let, $X = 1^n$
then $0^n01 \cdot X =0^n011^n$, which is in $L$.
Since, $W = 0^n011^n$ and if the two middle symbols of W are $w_k$ and $w_{k+1}$ then $w_k = 0$ and $w_{k+1} = 1$ and thus $w_k \not ={w_{k+1}}$
<!-- Since, length of $0^n011^n$ is $2n+2 = 2(n+1)$, hence $k = n+1$ and the, symbol at $k$ or $n+1$ is 0 and at $k+1$ or $n+1+1 = n+2$ is 1 and the symbols are different. -->
and $0^m01 \cdot X =0^m011^n$, where $n \not ={m}$, which is not in L.
Since, for $W = 0^m011^n$
as $m = n+2$, $w_k = w_{k+1} = 0$

Hence there is a different equivalence class for each string __$0^n01$__ with $n \geq 0$. Since there are an infinite number of such strings, the number of equivalence classes is infinite. By the Myhill-Nerode theorem, this concludes the proof that $L$ is not regular.
