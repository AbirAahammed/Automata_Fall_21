If $A \Delta B$ is the symemtric differencr of $A$ and $B$, then
We know that, $A \Delta B = (A \cup B) - (A \cap B) $

Now If $L_1$ and $L_2$ are regular then,
Since Regular languages are closed Union operation therefore $(L_1 \cup L_2)$ is regular language. [From lecture 21, slide 5 proof]
And since Regular languages are closed Intersection operation therefore $(L_1 \cap L_2)$ is regular language. [From lecture 21, slide 18 proof]
Since $(L_1 \cup L_2)$ and $(L_1 \cap L_2)$ are regular and regular languages are closed under difference operation. [From lecture 21, slide 19 proof]
therefore, $(L_1 \cup L_2) - (L_1 \cap L_2)$ is a regular language and we have shown, $L_1 \Delta L_2 = (L_1 \cup L_2) - (L_1 \cap L_2)$
Hence if $L_1$ and $L_2$ are regular language then their symmetric difference is also a regular language.
