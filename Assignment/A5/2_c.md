Let, 
-   $A = \{0, 1\}^*$
-   $B$ = { all binary string starting with 1 } 
-   $C : A $&rarr;$ B$ be defined as $C(W) = 1 \cdot W$

**To show that, C : A &rarr; B is one to one,**
1. Take any 2 $x$ and $y$ such that, $x, y \in A$, supoose that $C(x) = C(y)$
2. Evaluate $C(x)$ and $C(y)$, we get $1\cdot x$ and $1\cdot y$
Since $C(x) = C(y)$, we get $1\cdot x = 1\cdot y$, which implies $x=y$

**To show that,  C : A &rarr; B is onto,**
1. Let, $\beta = 1 \cdot x$ be an arbitrary element. As all string in $B$ starts with 1. And $x \in \{0, 1\}^*$
2. Define $\alpha = x$
3. Evaluate $C(\alpha)$: we get $C(\alpha) = C(x)= 1 \cdot x = \beta$

Therefore, $C$ is a bijection from $A \rightarrow B$. 

And in lecture 47, slide 4, the set of all binary strings that start with 1 is countable. Therefore, B or set of all binary string starting with 1 is countable.

Now, there exists a bijection $C$ from $A$ to $B$, and $B$ is countable therefore, $A$ or set of all binary string is also countable. Therefore, $L = \{0, 1\}^*$, is countable.
