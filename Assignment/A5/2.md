# a
$x \not ={y}$
$f(x) = f(y)$
$\implies 1 \cdot x = 1 \cdot y$
since, $x \not ={y}$
therefore,  $1 \cdot x \not ={1 \cdot y}$
or, $f(x) \not ={f(y)}$
Hence, C is one to one.

# b
We, $W = 1 \cdot W'$
Let $\beta$ be an arbitrary element of $1\cdot W$
we define, $\alpha = \beta$ without 1
$f(\alpha) = 1 \cdot \alpha= \beta$
Hence it is a ontol.

# c
If we can proof a bijection from a countable set to another set thant that set is also countable.

If A is a countably infinite and if $\exist$ bijection,
