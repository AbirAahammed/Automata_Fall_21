# a
To show that $C$ is one-to-one, the proof is:
1. Let, x, y be 2 arbitrary binary string, suppose that C(x) = C(y)
2. Evaluate C(x) and C(y), we get $1 \cdot x$  and $1 \cdot y$
   Since f(x) = f(y), we get $1 \cdot x$ = $1 \cdot y \implies x = y$
<!-- 
$x \not ={y}$
$C(x) = C(y)$
$\implies 1 \cdot x = 1 \cdot y$
since, $x \not ={y}$
therefore,  $1 \cdot x \not ={1 \cdot y}$
or, $C(x) \not ={C(y)}$
Hence, $C$ is one to one. -->

# b
To show $C$ is onto, the proof is:
1. Let $\beta$ be an arbitrary element of set of binary starting starting with 1.
2. Define, $\alpha = X$, such that, $\beta= 1 \cdot X$ 
3. Evaluate $C(\alpha)$: we get $C(\alpha)= C(X)= 1 \cdot X= \beta$

Hence $C$ is a onto.

# c
$C$ is bijection from set of all binary string to set of all binary string starting with 1.
Let, 
-   A = { all binary string } 
-   B = { all binary string starting with 1 } 
-   C : A &rarr; B
In lecture 47, slide 4, It was shown that, the set of all binary strings that start with 1 is countable. Therefore, B is countable.
Now, there exists a bijection $C$ from $A$ to $B$, and $B$ is countable therefore, $A$ or set of all binary string is also countable. Therefore, $L = \{0, 1\}^*$, is countable.
<!-- 
A set of all binary strin to B set of all binary  starting with 1. 
Now, Since there is a biject from $\mathbb{Z}^+ \rightarrow \{$Set of all binary starting with 1$\}$ [we have proved this in lecture]
Hence, $\{$Set of all binary string starting with 1$\}$ is countable.
Now since there is a bijecttion from set of all binary string to $\{$Set of all binary string starting with 1$\}$, set of all binaryb string is also countable.
If we can proof a bijection from a countable set to another set thant that set is also countable.

If A is a countably infinite and if $\exist$ bijection, 

C(W) maps all binary string to another binary string that starts with 1. let's set of all binary string that starts with 1 is $S_1$.

BinToDeci: $S_1$ &rarr; $\mathbb{Z}^+$.
Hence, $S_1$ is a countable set. And we have showed that, C(W) for $W \in \{0, 1\}^*$ is a bijection from all binary string to a new set $S_1$,
therefore, set of all binary string is also countable. or L is also countable.


Notes: 
-   for all $x, y\in A$, if $x\not ={y},$ then, $f(x)\not ={f(y)}$
-   for all $\beta \in B$, there exists $\alpha \in A$ such that, $f(\alpha) = \beta$ -->
