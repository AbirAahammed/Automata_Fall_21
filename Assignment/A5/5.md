#### First we prove, $HighSteps_{TM}$ is recognizable.
We define the following algorithm $\mathscr{f}$ on input string $W$:
-  if $W \not ={<T>}$ for any Turing Machine $T$, then output $\epsilon$
-  if $W=<T>$ for some Turing Machine $T$, then output $<M_c, y>$ where $M_c$ is the following Turing machine algorithm:
   1. for a in {0, ..., 420}
      1. for each x in $\{0, 1\}^a$
         1. Simulate T with x upto 420 transitions or steps. If halts before 420 steps, then ***Reject*** y.
         2. Move to next iteration of loop.
      2. Move to next iteration of loop.
   2. ***Accept*** y

**Prove, that f(W) is the correct reduction.**

-  First, suppose that $W \in HighSteps_{TM}$
   -  then $W = <T>$ and $f(W) = <M_c, y>$ where $M_c$ never enters in the reject state and accept $y$ in point 2.
   -  So no matter what input y is provided, the machine $M_c$ always accepts
   -  In particular, $M_c$ accepts at least one input (for example, $M_c$ accepts $\epsilon$)
   -  therefore, $f(W)=<M_c, y> \in Accept_{TM}$
-  Next, suppose that $W \notin HighSteps_{TM}$
   -  case 1: $W \not ={<T>}$
      -  $f(W) = \epsilon \notin Accept_{TM}$
   -  case 2: $W = <T>$ 
      -  $f(W)=<M_c, y>$ and $M_c$ halts for some $x \in \{0, 1\}^1 \cup \{0, 1\}^2 \cup .....\cup \{0, 1\}^{420}$ and rejects y.
      -  So no matter what input y is provided, the machine $M_c$ always rejects y
      -  therefore, $f(W)=<M_c, y> \notin Accept_{TM}$

Hence, $HighSteps_{TM} \leq_m Accept_{TM}$
Since, $Accept_{TM}$ is recognizable [lecture 57 slide 10] therefore, $HighSteps_{TM}$ is also recognizable

#### Then we prove, $\overline{HighSteps_{TM}}$ is recognizable.

We define the following algorithm $\mathscr{f}$ on input string $W$:
-  if $W \not ={<T>}$ then return $<M_u, y>$, where $M_u$ accepts all binary string
where $M_u$ is the following Turing machine algorithm:
     - keep going right starting from the first alphabet of the string if we see 0 or 1.
     - halt at empty symbol and accept.
-  if $W =<T>$, return $<M_c, y>$
where $M_c$ is the following Turing machine algorithm:
1. for a in {0, ..., 420}
   1. for each x in $\{0, 1\}^a$
      1. Simulate T with x upto 420 transitions or steps. If halts before 420 steps, then ***Accept*** y.
      2. Move to next iteration of loop.
   2. Move to next iteration of loop.
2. ***Reject*** y

**Prove, that f(W) is the correct reduction.**

-  First suppose that, $W \in \overline{HighSteps_{TM}}$
   -  case 1: $W \not ={<T>}$
      -  $f(W) = <M_u, y> \in Accept_{TM}$ $M_u$ accepts all binary string, even $\epsilon$
   -  case 2: $W = <T>$ 
      -  $f(W)=<M_c, y>$ and $M_c$ halts for some $x \in \{0, 1\}^1 \cup \{0, 1\}^2 \cup .....\cup \{0, 1\}^{420}$ and accepts y.
      -  So no matter what input y is provided, the machine $M_c$ always accepts
      -  In particular, $M_c$ accepts at least one input (for example, $M_c$ accepts $\epsilon$)
      -  therefore, $f(W)=<M_c, y> \in Accept_{TM}$

-  Next, suppose that, $W \notin \overline{HighSteps_{TM}}$
   -  then $W = <T>$ and $f(W) = <M_c, y>$ and $M_c$ never enters in the accept state and reject y in line 2.
   -  So no matter what input y is provided, the machine $M_c$ always rejects y
   -  therefore, $f(W)=<M_c, y> \notin Accept_{TM}$


Hence, $\overline{HighSteps_{TM}} \leq_m Accept_{TM}$

Since, $Accept_{TM}$  [lecture 57 slide 10] is recognizable therefore, $\overline{HighSteps_{TM}}$ is also recognizable

And we have a theorem, $L$ is decidable if and only if $L$ and $\overline{L}$ is recognizable. From Lecture 52 Slide 4 States.

Since, $HighSteps_{TM}$ and $\overline{HighSteps_{TM}}$ are recognizable therfore, $HighSteps_{TM}$ is decodable.
