## <center>L is decideable if and only if $L \leq_m 000^*(11+111)$</center>
**First we prove, If L is decideable then $L \leq_m 000^*(11+111)$**

If L is decidable then there is a TM $T_L$ that decides $L$
<!-- -   f(W)$\implies$
    1.   If $W \in L$
        1.1.   Simulate $T_L$ with input $W$, Since $W\in L$, $T_L$ will accpet $W$ then return <00011>.
    2.   else if $W \notin L$
        2.1.   Simulating $T_l$ with input W, Since $W\notin L$ and $L$ is decidable. $T_L$ will reject $W$ then return <0101>. -->

We define the following algorithm $\mathscr{f}$ on input string $W$:
    1. Simulate $T_L$ with input $W$, If $T_L$ enters accept state then return, <`00011`>
    2. Else return, <`0101`>
    
**Prove, that f(W) is the correct reduction.**
-   First, suppose that $W \in L$
    -   then $T_L$ will enter accept state as $T_L$ decides $L$, then $f(W)$ will return <`00011`>, and $00011\in \mathscr{L}(000^**(11+111))$ hence $f(W) \in \mathscr{L}(000^**(11+111)$

-   Next, suppose that $W \notin L$
    -   then $T_L$ will enter reject state as $T_L$ decides $L$, then  f(W) will return 0101, and $0101\notin \mathscr{L}(000^**(11+111))$ hence $f(W) \notin \mathscr{L}(000^**(11+111)$

Therefore, **$L \leq_m \mathscr{L}(000^*(11+111))$**

### Prove: If $L \leq_m 000^*(11+111)$ then L is decideable.
<!-- Since, regular expression defines a regular language and all regular languages are decidable. lecture 61 slide 3
:question: can we state that, regular languges are a subset of decidable language? -->

We have proved that $Accept_{RE}$ is decidable. Let, $M_{rex}$ is the machine that decides $Accept_{RE}$. $M_{rex}$ takes input $W = <R, x>$ where R is regular expression in binary encoding and x is a binary string. If $x \in R$ then $M_{rex}$ accepts else reject.
Now, we will modify $M_{rex}$ to generate a $M$, that decides, $000(11+111)$ and takes input W = x , where x is a binary string.

Algorithm for our machine $M$,
1. $M$ simulates $M_{rex}$ with input W = <R, x> where R = binary encoding of regular expression $000^*(11+111)$ and x is a binary string.
2. If the simulation ends in an accepting state of $M_{rex}$, then accept
   If the simulation ends in a reject state of $M_{rex}$, then reject.

Since, $M$ always halts as $M_{rex}$ always halts, and the simulation $M_{rex}$ enter accept state when $x \in \mathscr{L}(000^*(11+111))$ and thus $M$ accepts input $x$, If $x \notin \mathscr{L}(000^*(11+111))$ the simulation of  $M_{rex}$ enter reject state hence $M$ rejects $x$.

Hence, $M$ decides $\mathscr{L}(000^*(11+111))$
Therefore, $\mathscr{L}(000^*(11+111))$ is decidable.

<!-- 
We have proved that $Accept_{RE}$ is decidable. hence, for a regular expression $\mathscr{r}$ and an input $x$, we can always build a TM that simulate $RE$ for input x and if $x \in \mathscr{L}(RE)$ then TM halts and accept else reject. therefore, $\forall RE$, $\exist TM $ such that, $TM$ enters accept state for input $W$ if $W \in \mathscr{L}(RE)$ else $TM$ enters reject state.
Hence all for a regular expression $RE$, $\mathscr{L}(RE)$ is decidable.
**Therefore, $\mathscr{L}(000^*(11+111))$ is dicidable.**  -->

Now since, $L \leq_m 000^*(11+111)$
Therefore, **L is also decidable.**

Therefore, **L is decideable if and only if $L \leq_m 000^*(11+111)$**
