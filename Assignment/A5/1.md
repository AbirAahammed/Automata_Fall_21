# a
We choose, x and y such that, $x \not ={y}$, 
f(x) = f(y)

if there exists, a x and y where $x \not ={y}$ such that, $f(x) = f(y) $ we can show that D is not one to one.
Now let's $x = 0011$ and $y = 1010$ 
then, $f(x) =\#_1(x) - \#_0(x) = 2-2=0$
and, $f(y) =\#_1(y) - \#_0(y) = 2-2=0$
hence, f(x) = f(y)
therefore, D is not one to one.
