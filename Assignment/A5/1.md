# a
If there exists, 2 binary strings $x$ and $y$ where $x \not ={y}$ such that, $D(x) = D(y) $ we can show that D is not one to one.
Now let's $x = 0011$ and $y = 1010$ 
then, $D(x) =\#_1(x) - \#_0(x) = 2-2=0$
and, $D(y) =\#_1(y) - \#_0(y) = 2-2=0$
hence, D(x) = D(y)
therefore, D is not one to one. 
# b
<!-- 1. let $\beta$ be an arbitrary value in B
2. $\alpha =\{0, 1\}^*$ such that $\#_0(\alpha) = y$  and $\#_1(\alpha) = x$ where $x$ and $y$ are 2 non negative integer and $x -y = \beta$
3. $f(\alpha) = x-y$, beta -->

<!-- Final: -->
To show $D$ is onto, the proof is:
1. let $\beta$ be an arbitrary element of $\mathbb{Z}$
2. $\alpha =0^21^{2+\beta}$
3. $D(\alpha) =D(0^21^{2+\beta})= \#_1(0^21^{2+\beta}) -\#_1(0^21^{2+\beta})= 2+\beta - 2 = \beta$,

Hence $D$ is a onto.

<!-- Notes: 
-   for all $x, y\in A$, if $x\not ={y},$ then, $f(x)\not ={f(y)}$
-   for all $\beta \in B$, there exists $\alpha \in A$ such that, $f(\alpha) = \beta$ -->
