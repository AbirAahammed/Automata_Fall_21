$C$ is not onto, the proof is as follows:
let, $\beta = 0$
Now, let $\alpha = x$ where $x \in \{0, 1\}^*$
then, $C(\alpha) = 1 \cdot x$, therefore, $C(\alpha)$ always starts with 1 no matter what is $x$. Hence, $\forall x \in \{0,1\}^*,\  C(\alpha) = C(x) \not ={0} $
Hence, $\exist \beta \in \{0, 1\}^*, \forall \alpha \in \{0, 1\}^*$ such that, $C(\alpha) \not ={\beta}$

Hence $C$ is not onto.
