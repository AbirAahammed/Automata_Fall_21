Assume all such functions are coutable set. This means there is a bijection from f:{1, 2, 3,....} &rarr; S

Assign order to set of all binary strings and represnt these strings as $W_1, W_2, W_3,....$

**Define a function g:**
for each $i \in \{1,2,3,.....\}$ $g(W_i) = 1 \cdot q(W_i)$ where $f(i) = q$
**proof $f$ is not onto:** i.e. there is no $k$ such that, $f(k) = g$
consider an arbitrary $k \in \{1,2,3,...\}$
-   $g(W_k) = 1 \cdot f(k)(W_k)$
-   Now, $f(k)(W_k) = q(W_k)$ where $q = f(k)$,
-   For same string $W_k$, $g(W_k) \not ={q(W_k)} \implies g(W_k) \not ={f(k)(W_k)}$
-   hence, ($q$ or $f(k)$) and $g$ are different function

This contradicts the fact that, f is a bijection, so $S$ is not a countable.
