Assume $S$ is a countable set. This means there is a bijection f:{1, 2, 3,....} &rarr; S

Assign shortlex ordering to the set of all binary strings and represent these strings as $W_1, W_2, W_3,....$

**Define a function g:**
for each $i \in \{1,2,3,.....\}$ $g(W_i) = 1 \cdot f(i)(W_i)$
**proof $f$ is not onto:** i.e. there is no $k$ such that, $f(k) = g$
consider an arbitrary $k \in \{1,2,3,...\}$
1.  $g(W_k) = 1 \cdot f(k)(W_k)$
2.  Therefore,  $g(W_k) \not ={f(k)(W_k)}$
3.  For some binary string $W_k$ $g(W_k) \not ={f(k)(W_k)}$
4.  hence, $f(k)$ and $g$ are different function

This contradicts the fact that, f is a bijection, so $S$ is not a countable set.
