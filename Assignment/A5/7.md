$L =\{W \in \{0, 1\}^∗ |W =〈T, c〉$ where T is a $USTM$, $c ∈{Red,Blue}$
We will prove, $Accept_{TM} \leq_m L$
We define the following algorithm $\mathscr{f}$ on input string $W$:
-   if $W \not ={<T, X>}$ then return $\epsilon$
-   Else return <M, c> where $M$ is the following Turing Machine algorithm:
    1. We use a special variable for each state to mark the color of the state.
    2. All state but the accept state is marked <span style="color:red">Red</span>. We then mark the final state <span style="color:blue">Blue</span>. Let, c = <span style="color:blue">Blue</span>.
    3. Simulate $T$ with input $X$
    4. If the simulation enters a **Accept** state , then **Accept** my input immediately.
Else If, the simulation enters a **Reject** state , then **Reject** my input immediately.


##### Proof f(W) is the correct reduction:
-   First, suppose that $W \in Accept_{TM}$.
By definition of $Accept_{TM}$, $W = <T, X>$  and $T$ accepts $X$.
    -   Then, f(W) = <M, c>
    -   On line 4 of M defined by $\mathscr{f}$, If T accepts $X$, then $M$ will accept.
    -   In particular, this means $M$ eventually accepts any input, therefore, we will reach the **Accept** state colored **c** or **Blue**.
    -   therefore, $f(W) \in L$ 
-   Next, suppose that,  $W \notin Accept_{TM}$.
    -   Case 1: $W \notin Accept_{TM}$ because $W \not ={<T, X>}$
        -   $f(W) = \epsilon$ therefore, $f(W)\notin L$
    -   Case 2: $W \notin Accept_{TM}$ because $W ={<T, X>}$ but, $T$ doesn't accept $X$
There are two possibilities:
        -  <ins>Case 2(a): $T$ doesn't halt on Input $X$</ins>
Then $M$ doesn't halt on line 4 when simulating $T$ on input $X$,
        -  <ins>Case 2(b): $T$ eventually rejects input $X$</ins>
Then $M$ rejects in line 4 when simulating $T$ on input $X$,
        -   In both cases, $M$ never enters accept state for any input, whcih is colored c = <span style="color:blue">Blue</span>. therefore, $<M, c> \notin L$
  
Therefore the reduction is proved, and $Accept_{TM} \leq_m L$
Now since, $Accept_{TM}$ is undedidable, therefore, $L$ is undecidable.
