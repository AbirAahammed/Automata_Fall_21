$Accept_{TM} \leq_m L$
$f(W) \implies$
if $W \not ={<T, x>}$ then return $\epsilon$
else returnm <M, c>

Define TM $M$ as follows:
1. We use a special variable for each staten to mark the color of the state.
2. All state but the accept state is marked <span style="color:red">Red</span>. We then mark the final state <span style="color:blue">Blue</span>. Let, c = Blue.
3. Simulate $T$ with input $x$ is it reaches accept state then accept.


##### Proof f(W) is the correct reduction:
-   If $W \in Accept_{TM}$ then, 
    -   f(W) = <M, c>
    -   T will eventually enter accept state in line 2 and so will M, therefore, we will reach the state colored **c** or **Blue**.
    -   therefore, $f(W) \in L$ 
-   If  $W \notin Accept_{TM}$ then,
    -   Case 1: $W \not ={<T, x>}$
        -   $f(W) = \epsilon$ therefore, $f(W)\notin L$
    -   Case 2:$W ={<T, x>}$ but, $T$ doesn't accept $x$
        -   M never enter accept state, thus never enters a state colored **c** or **blue**
        -   hence, $f(W) = <M, c> \notin L$.
  
Therefore the reduction is valid, and $Accept_{TM} \leq_m L$
Now since, $Accept_{TM}$ is undedidable, therefore, $L$ is undecidable.
