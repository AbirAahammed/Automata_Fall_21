To show that $C$ is one-to-one, the proof is: [We will prove the contrapositive of definition of one-to-one, i.e. $[x \not ={y}] \implies [f(x) \not ={f(y)}]$
1. Let, x, y be 2 arbitrary binary string, suppose that C(x) = C(y)
2. Evaluate C(x) and C(y), we get $1 \cdot x$  and $1 \cdot y$
   Since C(x) = C(y), we get $1 \cdot x$ = $1 \cdot y \implies x = y$
therefore, $C$ is one to one.
