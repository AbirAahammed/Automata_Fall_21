Suppose $L_1$ and $L_2$ are recognizable.  
Then there exists a TM $M_1$ that recognizes $L_1$,  
and there exists a TM $M_2$ that recognizes $L_2$

We build a TM $T$ that recognizes $L_1 \cap L_2$.
On input $W$, machine $T$ does the following:
1. Simulate $W$ on $M_1$
2. If $M_1$ halts in accept state then, Simulate $W$ on $M_2$ else reject.
3. If the simulation $M_2$ halts in accept state then accept else reject.

Proof the T recognizes: $L_1 \cap L_2$
-   Suppose that $W \in L_1 \cap L_2$, by definition of intersection, $W \in L_1$ and $W \in L_2$.
    -   Since, $M_1$ and $M_2$ recognizes $L_1$ and $L_2$ respectively, and $W \in L_1, L_2$, both $M_1$ and $M_2$ will eventually halt in accept state. And machint $T$ will enter accept state in line 3. And thus $T$ accepts $W$
-   Suppose that $W \notin L_1 \cap L_2$, by definition of intersection, $W \notin L_1$ or $W \notin L_2$.
    -   case 1: $W \notin L_1$ and $W \in L_2$:
        -   $M_1$ will halt in reject state or never halt, in both scenarios our machine $T$ doesn't accept $W$. Simulation of $M_2$ doesn't run. 
    -   case 2: $W \in L_1$ and $W \notin L_2$:
        -   $M_1$ will halt in accept state. Then T will simulate $M_2$ with input $W$.
        -   Simulation $M_2$ with input $W$ either enter reject state or never halts, in both scenarios our machine $T$ doesn't accept $W$.
    -   case 3: $W \notin L_1$ and $W \notin L_2$:
        -   Same as case 1, Simulation, either enters reject state or never halts in line 2 of our algorithm for machine $T$. And thus $T$ doesn't accept $W$
This conclude the proof the $T$ recognizes the language $L_1 \cap L_2$
Therefore, $L_1 \cap L_2$ is recognizable.
