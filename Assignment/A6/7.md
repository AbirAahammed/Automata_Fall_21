1. Pick language $L = \{W \in \{0,1,2\}^* | \#_2(W) = max \{\#_0(W),\#_1(W)\}\}$
2. Opponent gives us $p$
3. We pick a string $W \in L$ of length at least $p$
let, $W = 0^{p+1}1^p2^{p+1}$
4. Oponent devides W into five parts: $W = UVXYZ$ with, $|VY|>0$ and $|VXY| \leq p$
5. we choose, $i = 2$, And we have following cases:
Since We picked $W = 0^{p+1}1^p2^{p+1}$ and we know that, $|VXY| \leq p$, it follows that $VXY$ can not contain both a 0 and a 2, because there are p 1's between the last 0 and the first 2.
   -   **Case 1:** $VXY$ doesn't have any 2, therefore, $VXY = 0^m \cdot 1^n$ where, $m\geq 0 \wedge n\geq 0 \wedge m+n>0$
       -   Since, $VY$ doesn't contain any 2, and at least one of $V$ and $Y$ has length more than 1,  no matter how our oponent chooses, $V, X, Y$ $max(\#_0(UV^2XY^2Z), \#_1(UV^2XY^2Z)) > p+1$
       -   $\#_2(UV^2XY^2Z) = p+1$, as $\#_2(UVXYZ)$ doesn't change as $VXY$ doesn't have any 2 and in turns $V$ and $Y$ doesn't have any 2.
       -   Therefore, $max(\#_0(UV^2XY^2Z), \#_1(UV^2XY^2Z)) > \#_2(UV^2XY^2Z) \implies \#_2(UV^2XY^2Z) \not ={max(\#_0(UV^2XY^2Z), \#_1(UV^2XY^2Z))}$
       -   Hence, $UV^2XY^2Z \notin L$
   -   **Case 2:**$VXY$ does have 2, therefore, $VXY = 1^m \cdot 2^n$ where, $m \geq 0$ and $n > 0$
       -   $\#_2(VY) = n_2$ and $\#_1(VY) = n_1$,since, $|VY|>0$, $n_1+n_2>0$
           -   $\#_0(UV^2XY^2Z) = \#_0(UVXYZ) =  p+1$ as this $VXY$ doesn't have any 0 in turns $V$ and $Y$ doesn't have any 0. 
           -   $\#_1(UV^2XY^2Z) = p+2n_1$
           -   $\#_2(UV^2XY^2Z) = p+1+2n_2$
           -   Since, both, $n_1$ and $n_2$ can not be 0, therefore, either, $p+2n_1 > p+1$ or  $p+1+2n_2 > p+1$
       -   **Case 2a:** $p+2n_1 > p+1$ and $p+1+2n_2 = p+1$ ,  [$V\cdot Y = 1^l$ for some $l>0 \wedge l\leq n_1$]
           -   from Case 2a condition, $max(\#_0(UV^2XY^2Z), \#_1(UV^2XY^2Z)) = p+2n_1$
           -   and since for this case, $n_2= 0$ therefore, $\#_2(UV^2XY^2Z) = p+1+2n_2 = p+1$
           -   In this case, $p+2n_1 > p+1 \implies max(\#_0(UV^2XY^2Z), \#_1(UV^2XY^2Z)) > p+1$
               $\implies max(\#_0(UV^2XY^2Z), \#_1(UV^2XY^2Z)) > \#_2(UV^2XY^2Z)$
           -   Therefore, $max(\#_0(UV^2XY^2Z), \#_1(UV^2XY^2Z)) \not ={\#_2(UV^2XY^2Z)}$, and thus, $UV^2XY^2Z \notin L$
       -   **Case 2b:** $p+1+2n_2 > p+1$ and $p+2n_1 = p$ [$V\cdot Y = 2^r$ for some $r>0 \wedge r\leq n_2$]
           -   from case 2b condition, $max(\#_0(UV^2XY^2Z), \#_1(UV^2XY^2Z)) = p+1$
           -   and $p+1+2n_2 > p+1 \implies \#_2(UV^2XY^2Z) > max(\#_0(UV^2XY^2Z), \#_1(UV^2XY^2Z)) $
               $\implies \#_2(UV^2XY^2Z) \not ={max(\#_0(UV^2XY^2Z), \#_1(UV^2XY^2Z))}$
           -   Therefore, $UV^2XY^2Z \notin L$
       -   **Case 2c:** $p+2n_1 > p+1$ and  $p+1+2n_2 > p+1$ [$V\cdot Y = 1^l2^r$ for some $l,r>0 \wedge l \leq n_1 \wedge r\leq n_2$]
           -   from case 2c condition, $max(\#_0(UV^2XY^2Z), \#_1(UV^2XY^2Z)) = \#_1(UV^2XY^2Z) = p+2n_1$
           -   Let's assume, $UV^2XY^2Z \in L$,
               -   therefore, $p+2n_1 = p+1+2n_2 \implies 2n_1 = 1+2n_2 \implies 2n_1 - 2n_2 = 1$, this is not possible, as $2n_1$ and $2n_2$ are both even number and the difference of 2 even integer can not be a odd number or in this case 1, hence, our assumption was wrong. And $UV^2XY^2Z \notin L$
6.  Thus we have shown that in call cases, $UV^2XY^2Z \notin L$

**So by Pumping Lemma, $L$ is not regular.**
