$Sober_{TM} = \{ W \in \{0, 1\}^*|W = <T>$ where T is a TM that will never accept any input that has length exactly 420$\}$

$\implies Sober_{TM} = \{ W \in \{0, 1\}^*|W = <T>$ where T is a TM and $\forall X \in \mathscr{L}(T)$ $|X| \not ={420}$ $\}$

$\implies Sober_{TM} = \{ W \in \{0, 1\}^*|W = <T>$ where T is a TM and $\mathscr{L}(T)$ has property $\mathscr{P}$}

And, $\mathscr{P} = $ " $\forall X \in \mathscr{L}(T)$,  $|X| \not ={420}$ " or $X \notin \{0,1\}^{420})$

Now let, $L_f = \{0,1\}^{420}$ and $|L_f| = 2^{420}$ therefore,  $L_f$ is a finite language. And all finite language are regular, [from answer to Assignment 2 question 1(a)]. For all regular language there is a DFA, let $D$ is the DFA that decides $L_f$ [from slide 2 lecture 8]

Proving that the property $\mathscr{P}$ is non-trivial 

We have proved, $Accept_{DFA}$ is decidable hence, there exist a machine $U$ that decides $Accept_{DFA}$ [the machine is defined at slide 8 lecture 50]

We build $M_1,$, $M_1$ takes input $W \in \{0, 1\}^*$
-   We Simulate machine $U$  on input $<D, W>$
-   IF the simulation enters accept state then reject else accept.
$\mathscr{L}(M_1)$ has the property $\mathscr{P}$

Next we build $M_2$, $M_2$ takes input $W \in \{0, 1\}^*$
-   we Simulate machine U [slide 8 from lecture 50] on input $<D, W>$
-   IF the simulation enters accept state then accept else reject.
$\mathscr{L}(M_2)$ does not have the property $\mathscr{P}$

Since $\mathscr{P}$ is non-trivial therefore $Sober_{TM}$ is undecidable.
