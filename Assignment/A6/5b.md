The required CFG as follows:
Z → PC | AQ | AR | ɛ
P → X
C → 2C | 2
A → 0A | 0 | ɛ
Q → YC
R → BY
X → 0X1 | 01
Y → 1Y2 | 12
B → 1B | 1

*   So G = (V,T,R,S) where
    *   V = {Z, P, C, A, Q, R, X, Y, B}
    *   T = {0, 1, 2}
    *   R = {Z → PC | AQ | AR | ɛ,
        P → X,
        C → 2C | 2,
        A → 0A | 0 | ɛ,
        Q → YC,
        R → BY,
        X → 0X1 | 01,
        Y → 1Y2 | 12,
        B → 1B | 1}
    *   S = {Z} (the variable to the left of first arrow)
