$L = \{W \in \{0, 1\}^*|W = <T,c>$ where T is a USTM, $c\in \{Red, Blue\}$, and; there exists at least one binary input string $X$, such that, $T$ executed on input $X$ enters a state coloured $c\}$
We will prove, $L \leq_m Accept_{TM}$
We first make an shortlex ordered list of all finite binary string $X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4, .....$ we wil use this strings inout algorithm.

We define the following algorithm $\mathscr{f}$ on input string $W$:
-   If W is a correct Encoding $<T, c>$ then return <M, y> where $M$ is the following Turing Machine algorithm:
     1.   for i = 1,2,3,...
          1.   for each j = 1,...,i
               1.   Simulate T on input $X_j$ for i steps (steps = transition)
               2.   If the simulation of T on $X_j$ enters $T$'s state $q$ such that $q$ is colored $c$ , wihtin these i steps, then **accept**
-   Else If $W$ is not a correct Encoding then, return $\epsilon$

##### Proof f(W) is the correct reduction:
-   First, suppose that $W \in L$.
By definition of $L$, $W = <T, c>$  and there exists at least one binary input string $X$ such that $T$ executed on input $X$ enters a state coloured $c$.
    -   Then, $f(W) = <M, y>$
    -   On line, 1.1.2 of algorithm for M for some i and j the simulation of T will enter state colored $c$ and no matter what input y is provided, the machine $M$ always accepts.
    -   Therefore, $f(W) = <M, y> \in Accept_{TM}$
-   Next, suppose that $W \notin L$.
    -   There are two possibilities:
        -   <ins>Case 1: $W$ is not the correct encoding.</ins>
            -   $f(W) = <\epsilon> \notin Accept_{TM}$
        -   <ins>Case 2: $W = <T, c>$ but $\forall X \in \{0, 1\}^*$ when $T$ is executed on input $X$ $T$ never enters state colored $c$  </ins>
            -   $f(W) = <M, y>$ and by definition of $f$, M never enters accept state in line, 1.1.2 of algorithm $M$, therfore, the machine M never halts. hence, $f(W) = <M, y> \notin Accept_{TM}$

Therefore the reduction is proved, and $L \leq_m Accept_{TM}$.
Since, $Accept_{TM}$ is recognizable, from slide 6 and 7 of Lecture 49, $L$ is also recognizable.
