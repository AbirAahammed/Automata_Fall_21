-   $\overline{Equal_{TM}}$ is urecognizable this is true according to the answer of Assignment 5 question 6.
-   From slide 9 lecture 57 $Equal_{TM}$ is unrecognizable.

Now, $Equal_{TM} \cup \overline{Equal_{TM}} = \{0, 1\}^*$
Now we know, $\{0, 1\}^*$ is recognizable as we can build a TM that recognizes set of all binary string, let that machine be $M$, where M is as follows,
1. keep going right starting from the first alphabet of the string if we see 0 or 1. 
2. Halt at empty symbol and accept.

Therefore, $\exist$ a $L_1 = Equal_{TM}$  and $\exist$ a $L_2 = \overline{Equal_{TM}}$ where, $L_1\cup L_2 = Equal_{TM} \cup \overline{Equal_{TM}} = \{0, 1\}^*$ and $L_1$ and $L_2$ are unrecognizable but $L_1\cup L_2$ is recognizable, Hence the statement  that **the set of all unrecognizable languages is not closed under union** is true.
